## Introduction
**1.1 Food Insecurity**

Food insecurity is the lack of consistent access to enough safe and nutritious food for normal growth and [development<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1). It prevents people from maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle. There are a multitude of factors that plague communities and contribute to food insecurity. Examples include climate change affecting crop yields, poverty limiting people’s ability to afford food, conflicts and wars disrupting food supply chains and poor infrastructure making it harder for food to reach those in [need<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2).

Throughout history, humans have continuously faced the challenge of producing enough food to sustain an ever-growing population. To adapt, three major revolutions in agriculture have taken place. During the First Agricultural Revolution, people shifted from hunting and gathering to farming and domesticating animals, allowing for more stable food sources. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the Second Agricultural Revolution introduced mechanisation, crop rotation and selective breeding, greatly increasing agricultural [productivity<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3). The Green Revolution then gained momentum in the 1900s and replaced traditional methods of cultivation. It involved new high-yield crop varieties, synthetic fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation systems, which significantly boosted global food production and helped reduce famine in developing [countries<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4). Advances in science and technology have enabled us to produce food more efficiently, feeding a growing global population. 

**1.1.1 Increasing Food Production**
Success in increasing food production has continued in recent years. Globally, [hunder<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5) levels have dropped, with the percentage of [undernourished<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6) decreasing from [12% to 8%<sup>7</sup>](#footnote-7). This can also be attributed to a combination of improved agricultural practices, better food distribution, economic growth, social programs and political [stability<sup>8</sup>](#footnote-8).

**1.1.2. Beyond Food Production: The Other Dimensions of Food Insecurity**
While the physical food availability is important, it is only one aspect of food insecurity. Economic and physical access to food, food utilisation and stability of these factors are equally [critical<sup>9</sup>](#footnote-9). In the pursuit of productivity and profit, issues such as rising food prices, environmental degradation and social inequalities were often overlooked or even [exacerbated<sup>10</sup>](#footnote-10). More importantly, many people still do not receive adequate nutrition from the food they consume, highlighting that availability alone does not guarantee [food security<sup>11</sup>](#footnote-11).

**1.1.3. Decreasing Nutritional Content in Food Produced**
A major conundrum of modern food systems is the decline in nutritional quality. The focus on high-yield, fast-growing crop varieties, coupled with the intensive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, has gradually reduced the levels of essential vitamins and minerals in staple foods. Research shows that modern crops such as rice, wheat and maize contain lower concentrations of nutrients like iron, zinc and protein compared to traditional varieties.[<sup>12</sup>](#footnote-12) Furthermore, monoculture farming and soil degradation have limited the diversity of nutrients available in our diets.[<sup>13</sup>](#footnote-13)

Simultaneously, global diets have shifted towards highly processed, calorie-dense but nutrient-poor foods.[<sup>14</sup>](#footnote-14) This trend widens dietary inequality as nutritious food becomes more expensive to produce and less accessible.[<sup>15</sup>](#footnote-15) Resultantly, individuals who rely primarily on affordable and convenient unhealthy options are more susceptible to maladies such as weakened immune system and mental health problems due to malnutrition.[<sup>16</sup>](#footnote-16)[<sup>17</sup>](#footnote-17) 
	
**1.1.4. The Fourth Agricultural Revolution**
The Fourth Agricultural Revolution, also known as Agriculture 4.0 and smart farming, represents the next phase in agricultural transformation driven by digitalisation and advanced technologies. It integrates tools such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, big data analysis and precision farming systems to enhance productivity while minimising environmental impact. Unlike previous revolutions that prioritised increasing output, Agriculture 4.0 emphasises sustainability and data-driven decision-making.[<sup>18</sup>](#footnote-18) Through real-time monitoring of soil conditions, crop health and resource use, farmers can optimise inputs like water and fertilisers, thereby improving yields without depleting natural resources.[<sup>19</sup>](#footnote-19)

Addressing food insecurity today requires a dual focus: not only increasing food production but also improving the nutritional quality of food and ensuring equitable access to them. Agriculture 4.0 provides an opportunity to achieve this balance by combining innovation with inclusivity. By leveraging technology to make healthy and sustainable food more accessible and affordable, it has the potential to transform global food systems into ones that support both human health and environmental resilience. 



















This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
