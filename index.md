## Introduction {: #introduction }
**1.1 Food Insecurity**

Food insecurity is the lack of consistent access to enough safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development.[Link Text<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) It prevents people from maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle. There are a multitude of factors that plague communities and contribute to food insecurity. Examples include climate change affecting crop yields, poverty limiting people’s ability to afford food, conflicts and wars disrupting food supply chains and poor infrastructure making it harder for food to reach those in need. [Link Text<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2)

	Throughout history, humans have continuously faced the challenge of producing enough food to sustain an ever-growing population. To adapt, three major revolutions in agriculture have taken place. During the First Agricultural Revolution, people shifted from hunting and gathering to farming and domesticating animals, allowing for more stable food sources. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the Second Agricultural Revolution introduced mechanisation, crop rotation and selective breeding, greatly increasing agricultural productivity.[Link Text<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3) The Green Revolution then gained momentum in the 1900s and replaced traditional methods of cultivation. It involved new high-yield crop varieties, synthetic fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation systems, which significantly boosted global food production and helped reduce famine in developing countries.[Link Text<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4) Advances in science and technology have enabled us to produce food more efficiently, feeding a growing global population. 

**1.1.1 Increasing Food Production**
Success in increasing food production has continued in recent years. Globally, hunger [Link Text<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5) levels have dropped, with the percentage of undernourished[Link Text<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6) decreasing from 12% to 8%.[Link Text<sup>7</sup>](#footnote-7) This can also be attributed to a combination of improved agricultural practices, better food distribution, economic growth, social programs and political stability.[Link Text<sup>8</sup>](#footnote-8)

**1.1.2. Beyond Food Production: The Other Dimensions of Food Insecurity**
While the physical food availability is important, it is only one aspect of food insecurity. Economic and physical access to food, food utilisation and stability of these factors are equally critical.[Link Text<sup>9</sup>](#footnote-9) In the pursuit of productivity and profit, issues such as rising food prices, environmental degradation and social inequalities were often overlooked or even exacerbated.[Link Text<sup>10</sup>](#footnote-10) More importantly, many people still do not receive adequate nutrition from the food they consume, highlighting that availability alone does not guarantee food security.[Link Text<sup>11</sup>](#footnote-11)


This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
